###About the Project

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds by Udacity. The tests are added using Jasmine to check the functionalites of the code written.

###How to run the Project

- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/aayusharora/Feed-Reader-Testing.git`
- Open index.html in your browser.

###Technologies Used

- Jasmine
- jQuery
- HTML5/CSS3

###About the FeedReader
The FeedReader loads feeds from 4 different blog websites: Udacity Blog, CSS Tricks, HTML5 Rocks and Linear Digressions. You can navigate from blog-to-blog by clicking the menu icon in the left top corner and selecting a blog. Clicking on a blog title it will redirect you to that specific website/blog post.

###Resources
 - The Feed Reader was provided by Udacity. I've added all of the tests for Jasmine.
